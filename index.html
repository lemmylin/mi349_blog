                Amazon’s strategic focus is to create the target customer and achieve synergy. Amazon uses its algorithm to
                precisely target customers and gives them exactly what they need at the right time. It not only makes the
                customer impulse purchase it also helps them to boost sales. Amazon also differs from other online retailers
                because they have their own warehouse, their own shipping service. They also partnered with different
                companies to use their warehouse and shipping service to make sure that the experience for the customer is
                as seamless as possible while delivering the product within their promised 2 days period. This level of
                supply chain integration is nowhere to be found inside of the United States of America other than Amazon.
                Other countries have done this, but in the USA, Amazon definitely takes the lead. Even at places where they
                don’t deliver, they still manage to partner with other shipping companies and use their algorithm to
                calculate and make sure the package still arrives within the time frame. It is amazing how Amazon can manage
                to deliver to so many people in so many places in such a short time. From the sale to the delivery, Amazon
                controls it all and that is how they achieve this level of competitive advantage.

            <h3>Using Social Media To Analyze Behavior</h3>
            <h4>Published Date: October 14, 2021</h4>

                Understanding the environment or influencing the environment can be a big advantage of using social media
                analytics. The primary advantage of using social media analytics is that you can gather huge amounts of data
                without actively collecting them from people. Most people tend to be their very true selves on the internet,
                there is less filtering of their speech and more expressing their actual opinions. Those data can then be
                used to analyze the current trend in the world or among a certain group of people are. Such as the study on
                the anti-vaccine group, we can learn more about why and what is making them anti-vax. Since they are
                collected anonymously, a particular individual will most likely be identified and most people should not
                worry about how their data are being analyzed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the positive aspect is that analyzing social media posts helps us better understand some people. It
                also helps us to predict, through models, future trends and make better decisions on certain things.
                However, on the other hand, the negative aspect is that there will be people against this methodology as
                they think of it as private information that is being stolen from them; further losing their trust in the
                platform, which might lead to the bias of the results.
